# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
explore and summarize data using R on Wine data set 

# reflection

My main feature of interest was wine quality and I could find some variables which tend to influence this factor, like alcohol content and density. In the first part I made some simple hitograms about the main factors and other variables as well. In the part of bivariate analysis, I tried to get a better knowledge on the factors which influence wine quality. I was suprised that residual sugar, pH, citric acid and fixed acidity do not correlate with wine quality.

i could make some other interesting explorations in the future, like trying another models for fit the data well like non linear regression model

or using classification models with output from 3 to 9

The project work took me more time than I previously estimated

It took time to choose the best corresponding plots and to detect the variables that influence quality. I had to examine each variable separatly while not forgetting the whole picture which I found really challenging and exciting.
